To follow the Go SDK tutorials we recommend that you have the following environments set up.

## Terminal

The Go SDK tutorials make use of a command line terminal for file/directory management and program execution. We recommend that you have your favorite terminal open and ready to go.

## Go

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed.

## Temporal server

Download and install the [Temporal server](/docs/install-temporal-server) via docker-compose. It is easy to do and you can keep it running in the background while you build applications.

## Tutorial directory

Somewhere inside your GOPATH (i.e. go/src/github.com/{your-username}) create a new Temporal tutorial directory:

```
mkdir temporal-go-tutorials
cd temporal-go-turotials
```
